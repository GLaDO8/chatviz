# Chat visualization features
There are a lot of tools outside which let you visualize your chatting behavior with your friend or your partner, but most of them require you to mail/upload your chat data and *compromise on privacy*. Moreover, the visualizations provided are either *limited or dull.* 

*chatviz* tackles both the issues. By making the code open-source and bringing the analytics engine to the user-end, you have complete control over your data. In order to further enhance security, *chatviz* automatically *flushes all variables and tables* once analysis is done. 

*chatviz* provides visualizations on key features like 

* Total no of messages
* total no of words
* Total no of days
* Average no of words per message
* Average length of a message
* Average messages per day
* Yearly no of messages for each sender
* Monthly activity for each sender
* Hourly activity for each sender
* Weekly activity (spider graph)
* Chronological graph
* Most used words for each sender
* Most used emojis for each sender
* Media sent by each sender
* Direct comparison of two senders (who texts more by what %, who sends images more by what % etc)
* Links sent by each sender
* Timeline title (from start data to end data)
* Most active day
* Sentiment analysis
